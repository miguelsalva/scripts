# ABSTRACT: This script reads the content from a given COLUMN in an excel file (passed as an argument),
#           points out the content with more than WORD_MAX_SIZE characters, separates the allowed content by 
#           a SEPARATOR and writes the output into a TXT_FILE. 
#
# This script requires the pandas library to run
